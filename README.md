# Deep Learning-Based Breath Sound Synthesis for Medical Simulations - Poster

This repository contains the project poster for my senior capstone project, which involved building a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to generate customizable lung sounds for medical training simulations.

**File included:**
- `Capstone_Poster.pdf` - Final poster presented at the University of Washington Bioengineering Capstone Showcase.

No code is included as this repository is intended solely to share the poster for application review.
